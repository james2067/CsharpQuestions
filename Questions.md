##    Q: What is a namespace?
Namespaces are used primarily in two ways.

**Organizing classes**

Look at the code: `System.Console.WriteLine("Hello world");`

System is the namespace. Console is the class inside of that namespace.

You can use the "using" keyword at the top of your program to eliminate some repetition here.

For Ex: `Using System;`

Now you can use: `Console.WriteLine("Hello World");`

**Custom namespaces**

You can create your own namespaces to use throughout larger projects.

For Ex:
`namespace ExampleNamespace
{
    class ExampleClass
    {
        public void ExampleMethod()
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine(
              "ExampleMethod inside ExampleNamespace");
        }
    }
}`

Doing this will help you control the scope of your classes, and the names of your methods throughout your program.
